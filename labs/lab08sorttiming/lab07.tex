\begin{description} 
\item[File names:]  Names of files, functions, and variables, 
when specified,
must be EXACTLY as specified.  This includes simple mistakes such
as capitalization.

\item[Individual work:]  All work must be your own.  Do not share
code with anyone other than the instructor and teaching assistants.
This includes looking over shoulders at screens with the code open.
You may discuss ideas, algorithms, approaches, {\em etc.} with
other students but NEVER actual code.  Do not use code
written by anyone else, in the class or from the internet.

\item[Documentation:] Each file should begin with a docstring
that includes your name, the class number and name, the lab
number, and  
a short description of the lab, as well as documentation pertinent
to that particular file.

\item[The project:]  Many of the $O(n^2)$ sorts are faster than the
$O(n\log n)$ sorts when they array is  small because they have
less overhead.  Also they can be faster when only a few points
are out of order, because  they can sort in
just a few passes.  If this is less than $\log n$, then it can be an
improvement.

Develop a series of tests ??????????????

\item[The project:] 
\item[File names:] Call your module {\tt tbst.py} and your unit test module
{\tt tbst\_test.py}, place in a folder {\tt csci112lab07yourname} zip and turn in to canvas.
